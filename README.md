## Setup Instructions

### Steps to Install and Run the Project

1. **Create a Virtual Environment with Python 3.10**

   To create a new virtual environment with Python 3.10, run:

   ```bash
   conda create -n cardezzdev python==3.10
   ```

2. **Activate the Conda Environment**
   
   Once the environment is created, activate it to start using the packages within this isolated setup:

   ```bash
   conda activate cardezzdev
   ```

3. **Install Necessary Libraries and Run Setup**

   After activating the environment, install the required libraries by running the setup script. This will configure the necessary dependencies for the application:

   ```bash
   python setup.py
   ```

4. **Navigate to the `gpt_3.5` folder**

   ```bash
   cd gpt_3.5
   ```

5. **Training Phase**

   Run the training script:

   ```bash
   python gpt_train.py
   ```

   Change your fine-tuned model name in the `gpt_app.py` file.

6. **Inference Phase**

   Run the inference script:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   You will get the inference on your local host at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
